# Military IDs Management System

A secure, auditable prototype for managing military identification cards — creation, verification, renewal, and audit logging — with clear user documentation and standard operating procedures.  
This repository contains the codebase, documentation, and sample data used during the project.

---

## Key features

- **ID Card Lifecycle Management** — Create, validate, renew, revoke military IDs.
- **Role-based access** — Separate admin and operator privileges.
- **Secure data handling** — Basic patterns for encryption-at-rest and audit logging (prototype).
- **User documentation & SOPs** — Step-by-step guides for administrators and end users.
- **Extensible architecture** — Clean separation of frontend, backend, and data layers for easy extension.

## Tech stack (prototype)

- Backend: Python (Flask / FastAPI suggested)
- Database: SQLite (prototype) — switchable to PostgreSQL for production
- Frontend: React (or simple server-rendered templates)
- Auth: Role-based tokens (JWT prototype)
- Documentation: Markdown under `/docs`

> This repo contains a prototype and documentation. It is **not** production-ready for sensitive deployments — follow your organization’s security policies before any real deployment.
